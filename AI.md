Today I tried to use AI in VScode to build my website, and I found it is quite efficient. However, it can not fulfill my goals, maybe I need to improve my prompt skill.
#### ⚠️ It is no doubt that someone who is not familiar to use AI in certain tools will fall behind!

An agent is not just acting as the user, it is a new actor in your system.

It's not a year of agents, it's a decade of agents.

His picture on the wall can move___maybe everything can be interacted?

Today I tried to make an APP by using AI. 
First, I figure out how to use prompt to generate the codes(Gemini). And then I wrap the code to github. Finally I select Zeabur to connect and finalized the code, which is able to make the html file online and looks like an APP.
The tutorial link is from wechat. [https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PNvK-P6UcDlbXN9o6WISMQ]

The central challenge, and opportunity, lies in a new developer paradigm. We are no longer simply "bricklayers" defining explicit logic; we are "architects" and "directors" who must guide, constrain, and debug an autonomous entity. 

# 12.17 I build several agents with the help of google adk

### Quick Reference Table

| Pattern | When to Use | Example | Key Feature |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **LLM-based (sub_agents)** | Dynamic orchestration needed | Research + Summarize | LLM decides what to call |
| **Sequential** | Order matters, linear pipeline | Outline → Write → Edit | Deterministic order |
| **Parallel** | Independent tasks, speed matters | Multi-topic research | Concurrent execution |
| **Loop** | Iterative improvement needed | Writer + Critic refinement | Repeated cycles |
