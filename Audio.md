做了一首citypop的歌  
[Rhodes + synth pad, night city ambience.mp3](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24394218/Rhodes.%2B.synth.pad.night.city.ambience.mp3)  
    Japanese city pop (late 80s to early 90s), retro J-pop with soft funk and disco groove,
mid-tempo 98 BPM, smooth and laid-back rhythm,
warm Rhodes electric piano, clean chorus electric guitar, groovy bassline,
lush synth pads, tight drum kit with crisp snare, subtle handclaps,
night city / neon lights atmosphere, nostalgic, romantic, slightly melancholic,
soft intimate female vocal, gentle and mature tone,
tape warmth, light chorus, glossy reverb, clean mix  
   [Intro]
Rhodes + synth pad, night city ambience

[Verse 1]
Neon reflections on the wet street
I’m walking slow where we used to meet

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to smile, I try to breathe
But the night brings you back to me

[Chorus]
Stay close tonight
Don’t let the feeling disappear
Under the neon sky
I want you here, I want you near

[Verse 2]
Taxi lights pass like distant stars
Old memories inside my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I’m fine, but you can see
There’s still a part of you in me

[Chorus]
Stay close tonight
Don’t let the feeling disappear
Under the neon sky
I want you here, I want you near

[Bridge]
Short sax solo, dreamy and emotional

[Outro]
Fade out with Rhodes and synth pad
